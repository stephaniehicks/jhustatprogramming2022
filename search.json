    "text": "Freeze Results and avoid recomputing\nFreezing code output is generally used when you have either\n\nA large number of collaborators or\nMany computational documents created over a longer period of time\n\nIn both cases it can be challenging to fully re-execute every document when you render the site. This could be because some documents have esoteric or environment-specific requirements (e.g. require access/authentication to a data source) or due to general fragility of dependencies over time.\nUsing freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site.\nThe computational results of documents executed with freeze are stored in the _freeze/ directory, and re-used when needed to fulfill document renders.\nYou should check the contents of _freeze/ into version control so that others rendering the project don’t need to reproduce your computational environment to render it in their environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou will still want to take care to fully re-render your project when things outside of source code change (e.g. input data).\nYou can remove previously frozen output by deleting the _freeze folder at the root of your project.\n\n\nFor example, consider the _quarto.yml file.\nOne argument in the file is the freeze option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes:\nproject:\n  title: \"qmd_rmd\"\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n  \nexecute:\n  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render\nproject:\n  title: \"qmd_rmd\"\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nexecute:\n  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nfreeze controls whether execution occurs during global project renders.\nIf you do an incremental render of either a single document or a project sub-directory then code is always executed. For example:\n\n\nTerminal\n\n# render single document (always executes code)\nquarto render document.qmd\n\n# render project subdirectory (always executes code)\nquarto render articles"

My research is problem-forward: I develop statistical methods and software that are motivated by concrete problems, often with real-world, noisy, messy data. I’m also interested in developing theory for how to incorporate design thinking (alongside statistical thinking) in practice of data analysis.\nIf you want, you can find me on Twitter.

A student is obligated to refrain from acts which he or she knows, or under the circumstances has reason to know, impair the academic integrity of the University. Violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; knowingly furnishing false information to any agent of the University for inclusion in the academic record; violation of the rights and welfare of animal or human subjects in research; and misconduct as a member of either School or University committees or recognized groups or organizations.\nStudents should be familiar with the policies and procedures specified under Policy and Procedure Manual Student-01 (Academic Ethics), available on the school’s portal.\nThe faculty, staff and students of the Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins University have the shared responsibility to conduct themselves in a manner that upholds the law and respects the rights of others. Students enrolled in the School are subject to the Student Conduct Code (detailed in Policy and Procedure Manual Student-06) and assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the law and respects the rights of others. They are responsible for maintaining the academic integrity of the institution and for preserving an environment conducive to the safe pursuit of the School’s educational, research, and professional practice missions.\n\nCourse code of Conduct\nWe are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of course participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any work event, including group meetings, conferences, talks, parties, Twitter and other online media. This code of conduct applies to all course participants, including instructors and TAs, and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online, including GitHub project repos, Slack channels, and Twitter.\nCourse participants violating these rules will be referred to leadership of the Department of Biostatistics and the Title IX coordinator at JHU and may face expulsion from the class.\nAll class participants agree to:\n\nBe considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of other members.\nBe respectful. Disagreements happen, but do not require poor behavior or poor manners. Frustration is inevitable, but it should never turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Course participants should be respectful both of the other course participants and those outside the course.\nRefrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention. If you feel that someone has harassed you or otherwise treated you inappropriately, please alert Stephanie Hicks.\nTake care of each other. Refrain from advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. And, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Alert Stephanie Hicks if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n\n\n\nNeed Help?\nPlease speak with Stephanie Hicks or one of the TAs.
