Using any R package with a GitHub repository (that does not already have a pkgdown website), use `pkgdown` to create a website for the software package. \n\nThis could even been a package that you have written (or are working on creating right now). Otherwise, this could be a package that you have used previously or you can pick one you are not familiar with and just want to know more about!\n\n## Part 1A: Create website locally \n\nFork the GitHub repository from the original location to your own GitHub account. Clone the repository to your local computer. \n\nUse `usethis` and `pkgdown` to create a website locally for the R package of your choice. \n\n## Part 1B: Customize the website\n\nHere, you need to customize the website in **at least 5 ways**. How you customize is up to you. The `pkgdown` website has lots of suggestions for you to try out! \n\n## Part 1C: Create an example data analysis\n\nIn this part, you will create a data analysis (or a case study) where you demonstrate the functions in the R package. Specifically, you will add [another article or vignette](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html#navbar) titled \"Example analysis\" inside the `/vignettes` folder.  \n\nSimilar to Project 2, you must pick out a data set from [TidyTuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com) **that you have not worked with before** (i.e. not in a previous project or assignment from this class or from 776, but other classes or personal projects are acceptable). You must also demonstrate wrangling and ploting the data. Finally, your example analysis, must also demonstrate at least 2 functions from the R package in some way in the vignette. \n\nOther requirements for this part of vignette are the following: \n\n1. Pick any data set you wish from [TidyTuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com) to analyze. \n  - You must describe what is the question you aim to answer with the data and data analysis. \n  - You must describe and link to where the original data come from that you chose.\n  - You must include a link to a data dictionary for the data or create one inside the webpage. \n2. Load the data into R\n  - In this step, you must test if a directory named `data` exists locally. If it does not, write an R function that creates it programmatically.  \n  - Saves the data only once (not each time you knit/render the document). \n  - Read in the data locally each time you knit/render. \n3. Your analysis must include some form of data wrangling and data visualization. \n  - You must use at least eight different functions from `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `lubridate`, `stringr`, or `forcats`. \n  - You must use at least two functions from `purr`. \n  - Your analysis should include at least three plots with you using at least three different `geom_*()` functions from `ggplot2` (or another package with `geom_*()` functions). \n    - Plots should have titles, subtitles, captions, and human-understandable axis labels. \n    - At least one plot should using a type of faceting (`facet_grid()` or `facet_wrap()`). \n4. Apply at least 2 functions from the R package in the vignette. \n5. Summarize and interpret the results in 1-2 sentences.\n6. At the end of the data analysis, list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, etc) to help the TA with respect to making sure you met all the requirements described above. \n\n## Part 1D: Create a `README.md` file \n\nIf the package does not already include one, make and include a `README.md` file in the folder where the R package and pkgdown files are on your computer and add the following information below. \n\nIf it already has a `README.md` file, just edit the top of the file with the following information: \n\n- Include a URL to the GitHub link to where the original R package came from. \n- Include a URL to the deployed website that you will do in Part 1E, but it should be something like `https://jhu-statprogramming-fall-2022.github.io/biostat840-project3-pkgdown-<your_github_username>`.\n- Include a description of the 5 things you customized in your `pkgdown` website (excluding adding the example data analysis from Part 1C).\n\nThe readme must also include (if it does not already): \n\n- The title of package\n- The original author of the package (and you who made the website and example data analysis)\n- A goal / description of the package\n- A list of **exported** functions that are in the package. Briefly describe each function. \n- A basic example with one of the functions. \n\n## Part 1E: Deploy the website\n\nThe link to create a public GitHub repository for yourself to complete this part of Project 3 will be posted in CoursePlus. This creates an empty GitHub repository. \n\nWhen ready, deploy the website. \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Note\n\nYou need to modify the template code that is provided to you from GitHub when you set the remote. There will already be a remote `origin` (from where you cloned the repo), which you can see with \n\n``` {.bash filename=\"Bash\"}\ngit remote -v\n```\n\nTo change where you push your code, instead of \n\n``` {.bash filename=\"Bash\"}\ngit remote add origin <link>\n```\n\nYou want to use something like \n\n``` {.bash filename=\"Bash\"}\ngit remote add upstream <link>\n```\n\nand when you push, you use `git push -u upstream main`, for example.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n",
