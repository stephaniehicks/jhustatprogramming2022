If you forget, please re-visite your [previous lecture](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/jhustatprogramming2022/posts/2022-11-10-version-control-part-2/).\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nMaterial for this lecture was borrowed and adopted from\n\n-   <https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/index.html>\n-   <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pkgdown-components.html>\n\n# Learning objectives\n\n::: callout-note\n# Learning objectives\n\n**At the end of this lesson you will:**\n\n-   be able to build a website for your package\n-   Deploy your website on GitHub\n:::\n\n# Why do we want a website for our packages?\nThe primary reason to make a website for our packages is to make it more popular. Having a publicly available website is similar to create a home for your package where people know where to find you package. Reciprocally, you can tell others a more stable address, i.e. your website link, to find your package.\n\nMoreover, compare to the default reference manual, a website provides more interactability and accessibility. It is easier to navigate through different functions via clickable links or to follow through a vignette with a table of content in a point-and-click system. A website is also a more integrative resources where it keep records not only the reference manual and vignettes, but also change log and development history. All of these makes it easier for the users to understand and appreciate your package.\n\nIn addition, a website is a great place to market yourself and show your personality. Different from a `GitHub` repo which follows the same template, a website is the place where you have more freedom to show case your creativity. You can customize the websites and have more space to explain.\n\n# What is `pkgdown`?\nWhile creating a website can be a daunting task for people who don't have extensive web programming experience, `pkgdown` provides a shortcut. `pkgdown` can automatically generate a website of an R package, containing references to the enclosed function, different vignettes if exists, within two lines of code. It also helps to deploy the website to `GitHub` server. Amazingly, `pkgdown` allows an automatic update of the website following any changes made to the package that are uploaded to `GitHub`.\n\n# How to use `pkgdown`?\n\n## Live demonstration\nWhile the `pkgdown` website provides a comprehensive [walkthrough](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html) for those who set up their `GitHub` access using [personal access token](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html), it is slightly tricky for those whose access is [set up with SSH](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/jhustatprogramming2022/posts/2022-11-10-version-control-part-2/#ssh-background-and-setup). During this lecture, we live demonstrate how to deploy the website, specifically when `GitHub` access is via SSH instead of HTTPS.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Did you try `pkgdown::deploy_to_branch()`?\nIf you run into problem when running `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()` and get stuck, you should try to understand what the function does by reading its manual `?usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`. Is it possible to create the necessary `gh_pages` using `pkgdown::deploy_to_branch()`? Don't forget to set up the GitHub Action by calling `usethis::use_github_action(\"pkgdown\")`. Now you should be able to find access your website via <github_account_name.github.io/pkg_name>\n:::\n\n## Website customization\nThere is a lot of customization that is possible. Nevertheless, there is not a point-and-click system for it. You need to manually edit `_pkgdown.yml` following certain syntax. For examples, please refer to <https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/customise.html>.\n\n\n# Summary\nIn this lecture, we\n\n* introduce the package `pkgdown` that automates website\n* demonstrate how to use `pkgdown` to create website for an R package\n\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   Create hexagon sticker for your package <https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker>\n-   Explore badge accessibility<https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/badge-accessibility.html>\n:::\n\n",
