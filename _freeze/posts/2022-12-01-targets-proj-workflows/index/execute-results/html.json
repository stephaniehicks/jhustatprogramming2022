Instead, it is a R package that helps you to manage your analysis. You can think of `targets` as a butler who helps you to manage your analytics. These services include\n\n* to manage the ordering of your analysis so you won't confuse about the steps when reproducing an analysis\n* to save the output of each analytic procedures so you don't have to wait for repetitive runs of static results\n* to monitor the change in your code so you can update the only analytic tasks that changes are made\n* to reproduce the whole analysis with a click so you don't have to run multiple scripts\n\n# Why do we use `targets`?\n<iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/NeedyRipeKingbird' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='640' height='404'></iframe>\n\n`targets` helps us be more efficient at managing analytic workflows, and hence improve productivity with bare minimum efforts. Let me simply put this way, managing file names for your code or saved objects can be very painful. But `targets` can help you handle that when use in combination with other version control system `git`.  \n\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:100%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/jtFOBTQhSUmR5STTZx\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n\n# How to use `targets`\n\n[The {targets} R package user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) is a great source to learn how to use `targets`. The intro level of `targets` tutorial is well documented in [*Chapter 2 Walkthrough*](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html). Instead going through the chapter with you, I will focus on some tricks that is not discussed in the user manual. \n\n## Set up a `targets` workflow\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Start a new R project\nusethis::create_project(\"targets_eg\")\n# Config target workflow\ntargets::use_targets()\n```\n:::\n\n\n### (Optional) Version control packages with `renv`\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Config renv system\nrenv::init()\ntargets::tar_renv()\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf other people opens up this project on a different computer, `renv` will automatically install all the necessary packages, especially the same versions of those packages.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Important `renv` functions\nIdealistically, you need to keep track of your R packages in every analysis, similar to you version control your files using `git`. You may need to call the following functions periodically, i.e. after you add/remove necessary packages.\n\n* `targets::tar_renv()` updates `_targets_packages.R` by gathering all packages in your analytic workflow \n* `renv::status()` shows which packages are outdated or not recorded\n* `renv::snapshot()` updates your packages version number by taking a snapshot of your project library\n* `renv::restore()` restores all missing packages or packages whose version number doesn't match with the most updated snapshot.\n\nFor more information, visit <https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html>\n:::\n\n## Set up keyboard shortcuts\n`targets` provide some `addins` to help users navigate through workflow management with a click-and-point system. For example, if you click on the `Addins` button in the tool bar (highlighted in the screen capture below) which locates on the top of the RStudio window, you can see many options that help you to work with `targets`\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A screenshot of addins for `targets`](../../images/targets/Addins.png){fig-align='center' width=316}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith these addins, you don't necessarily have to remember all the functions to run `targets`, such as `targets::tar_make()`, `targets::tar_load()`, `targets::tar_visnetwork()`, etc.\n\nIf you prefer keyboard shortcuts, you can set up for these commonly used functions. In order to do that, you need to go to `Tools` -> `Modify Keyboard Shortcuts`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A screenshot of how to modify keyboard shortcuts](../../images/targets/ModifyShortcuts.png){fig-align='center' width=382}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith in the pop-up keyboard shortcuts menu, you can search `addin` or `targets` or a specific `target` addin function, e.g. `Load target at cursor` in the search box. You can customize the keyboard shortcut by clicking on the input box within the `Shortcut` column.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A screenshot of keyboard shortcuts menu](../../images/targets/ShortcutsMenu.png){fig-align='center' width=801}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Summary\n`targets` is a workflow management powerhouse. It offers much more utility than we covered today. [The {targets} R package user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) does an excellent job on explaining how to set up parallel computing with the system, to work with markdown systems (I managed my dissertation writing in `targets`), and many more. \n\nNevertheless, I need to warn you that learning `targets` could be intimidating at the beginning because of the setup process and new syntax. It may take multiple iterations or projects until you are comfortable using it. \n\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:63%;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/gn0iBkQjUG092\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"position:absolute\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n\nBut it is very rewarding and can save you a lot of time in the long run! It is a worthy investment of time. \n\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   `targets` website <https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/>\n-   The `targetopic`, a `targets` ecosystem <https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/packages.html>\n- A tutorial & reproducible example on calculating residential segregation indices with decennial US census data <https://github.com/boyiguo1/Tutorial-Residential_Segregation_Score>\n:::\n",
