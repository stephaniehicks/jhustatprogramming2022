Using RStudio for this lesson will be critical as RStudio includes a number of tools that make building R packages *much* simpler. \n\nFor the purposes of demonstration in this lesson, we will be building a package called `greetings` that has a single function called `hello()`. The `hello()` function takes a single argument called `name` (which is required) and makes a plot containing a message directed at `name`. For example,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(greetings)\nhello(\"Stephanie\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAdmittedly, this is not a useful package, but it allows us to demonstrate all of the necessary ingredients for building a simple R package.\n\n## Create a New R Package Project\n\n\nCreating a new R packages begins with creating a new RStudio project.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A screenshot of starting a New Project in R](../../images/screen/NewProject.png){fig-align='center' width=476}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou should choose **New Directory** as this will be a brand new project (not an existing project).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A screenshot of starting a New Directory for a New Project in R](../../images/screen/NewDirectory.png){fig-align='center' width=541}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, you should choose the \"Project Type\" as **R Package using devtools** (you may need to scroll down a little in that menu).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Create a R package using devtools](../../images/screen/UseDevtools.png){fig-align='center' width=536}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, you should specify the name of your package. For this example, we will use **greetings** as the name of the package. Also you should double check the name of the sub-directory listed under \"Create project as subdirectory of\" is a directory that you can find. \n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Note \n\nThe name of this directory **should not have any spaces in its name**. \n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Package name](../../images/screen/PackageName.png){fig-align='center' width=540}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nClick \"Create Project\" and allow R and RStudio to restart. You should get a brand new session. You will also see a window with a series of tabs. One of those tabs will be called **Build** and that will be important as we build our package.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Build menu](../../images/screen/BuildMenu.png){fig-align='center' width=781}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Configure Build Tools\n\nThe next step after creating a new project is to configure your build tools. Click on the **Build** tab and then **More** and then **Configure Build Tools...**.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Configure Build tools](../../images/screen/ConfigureBuild.png){fig-align='center' width=430}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the next screen, you should make sure that the check box for **Generate documentation with Roxygen** is checked. Then click the **Configure...** button.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Click the Configure button](../../images/screen/ConfigureButton.png){fig-align='center' width=550}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the next menu, make sure to check the check box for **Install and Restart**.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Check box for Install and Restart](../../images/screen/InstallRestart.png){fig-align='center' width=545}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThen click \"OK\" and then \"OK\" again to exit the options menu.\n\n\n\n\n## R Package Files\n\nIn this session, there will be the following files listed in the file browser.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Files are listed in the File browser](../../images/screen/FileMenu.png){fig-align='center' width=362}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe files we will focus on here are \n\n* the `DESCRIPTION` file; and \n* any files in the `R` sub-directory. This package will only have one R script in the `R` sub-directory.\n\nThere is no need to worry about the other files for now.\n\n# Edit main files\n\nNow, we need to write the R code and documentation for our one function in this package. \n\n## Add a R Script file\n\nFirst, create an R script in which the R code will go. You can do this by clicking on **File > New File > R Script**. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Saving a new R Script file called hello.R](../../images/screen/SaveRScript.png){fig-align='center' width=487}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Note \n\nMake sure that your R script is saved inside the `R/` sub-directory.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R Script file must be in the R/ sub-directory](../../images/screen/EmptyRScript.png){fig-align='center' width=1130}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, once you have your R Script created, you can start to write the function and the **documentation**. \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Note \n\nThe idea is that when you write a function in a R package, just above the function is the **documentation**. The function is written in the usual way and the documentation is written using a special style.\n\n:::\n\n## Documentation\n\nLet's start with the documentation. Here is the documentation for the `hello()` function.\n\n```r\n#' Print a Greeting\n#'\n#' Print a greeting for a custom name\n#'\n#' @details This function make a plot with a greeting to the name passed as an argument to the function\n#' \n#' @param name character, name of person to whom greeting should be directed\n#'\n#' @return nothing useful is returned.\n#'\n#' @import ggplot2\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' hello(\"Chris\")\n#'\n\n```\n\nWe will take each line of documentation in order:\n\n1. The first line is a short title for the function\n\n2. The next line is the \"description\" line and should be a slightly longer description of what the function does. Generally, this line is one sentence.\n\n3. This line contains the first **Roxygen directive**, which is `@details`. This directive indicates that the text that comes afterwards has detailed information about the function. \n\n4. The next Roxygen directive is the `@param` directive. This indicates the name of the parameter that the function will accept. In this case, this is the name to which the greeting will be directed.\n\n5. The `@return` directive indicates what the function returns to the user. This function does not return anything useful, but it is still useful to indicate that.\n\n6. This function requires the `ggplot()` function and associated plotting functions. Therefore we need to use the `@import` directive to indicate that we need to **import** all of the functions in the `ggplot2` package.\n\n7. We want to indicate with the `@export` directive that this function should be visible to the user (i.e. we want the user to call this function). Therefore, the function should be **exported** to the user. More complex packages may have many functions and not all of them will be functions that the user will need to call. In addition, any function that is exported is required to have documentation.\n\n8. Under the `@examples` directive, you can put R code that demonstrates how to call the function. Here, we provide a simple example of how to use the `hello()` function.\n\nOnce the documentation is written, we can write the code for the function itself. The complete R script file looks as follows.\n\n\n```r\n#' Print a Greeting\n#'\n#' Print a greeting for a custom name\n#'\n#' @details This function make a plot with a greeting to the name passed as an argument to the function\n\n#' @param name character, name of person to whom greeting should be directed\n#'\n#' @return nothing useful is returned.\n#'\n#' @import ggplot2\n#' @export\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' hello(\"Chris\")\n#'\nhello <- function(name) {\n        message <- paste0(\"Hello, \", name, \"!\")\n        ggplot() +\n                geom_text(aes(0, 0), label = message, size = 4) +\n                theme_minimal()\n\n}\n```\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Note \n\nIn the function we do not actually plot any data. \nWe just use the `ggplot()` function to setup a plot window so that we \ncan add the message using `geom_text()`.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Editing the DESCRIPTION file\n\nAfter writing the code and documentation we need to edit the `DESCRIPTION` \nfile for the package. This contains metadata about the package. Here is \nthe final `DESCRIPTION` file for the package.\n\n```r\nPackage: greetings\nTitle: Displays a greeting plot\nVersion: 1.0\nAuthors@R: \n    person(given = \"Stephanie\",\n           family = \"Hicks\",\n           role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\n           email = \"shicks19@jhu.edu\")\nDescription: This package displays a nice greeting for a custom name.\nImports: ggplot2\nLicense: GPL (>= 3)\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)\nRoxygenNote: 7.1.1\n```\n\nWe can go through each field one at time:\n\n1. `Package` is just the name of the package. In this case it is `greetings`.\n\n2. `Title` is a short description of the package.\n\n3. `Version` is the version number. This is the first version so we use 1.0.\n\n4. `Authors@R` indicates the author of the package (this is you!). This package only has one author but packages can have multiple authors. Look at the help file for `person()` to see how this is specified.\n\n5. `Description` provides a multi-sentence description of what the package does.\n\n6. `Imports` is only needed because the package imports the functions from the `ggplot2` package. You will need to add this line explicitly to the `DESCRIPTION` file.\n\n6. `License` indicates the legal license for the package. This should be an open source license and we use the GNU General Public License Version 3 here. You can read more about [R package licenses](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/). Every R package **must** have a license.\n\nThe remaining fields are auto-generated by RStudio and you don't need to worry about them for now.\n\n\n# Build and Install\n\nOnce you have the code, documentation, and `DESCRIPTION` file written, you can build the package and install it in order to try it out.\n\n## Within RStudio\n\nIn the **Build** tab, click the button labeled **Install and Restart**.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Click the Build tab to install and restart](../../images/screen/BuildPackage.png){fig-align='center' width=648}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nClicking this button will\n\n1. Build the R package\n\n2. Install the R package on your system\n\n3. Restart the R session\n\n4. Load your package using the `library()` function.\n\nOnce this is done, you can call the `hello()` function and see the results.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Now you can load and use the hello() function](../../images/screen/HelloPackage.png){fig-align='center' width=232}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Build Source Package\n\nOnce the package is completed, you must build a source package so that it can be distributed to others. This can be done in the **Build** menu and clicking **Build source package**.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Build the source package](../../images/screen/BuildSourcePackage.png){fig-align='center' width=548}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis will produce a file with a `.tar.gz` extension. This is the **package source file**. \n\nYou should see a screen that looks something like this.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Source file is built (file ends in a .tar.gz)](../../images/screen/PackageBuilt.png){fig-align='center' width=551}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOnce your package is built, you can send to others and they will be able to install it. The package source file would also be the file that would be uploaded to CRAN if you were submitting a package to CRAN.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Pro-tip\n\nIf you are interested, you can also use the `usethis` package to create, build, document, and intall a R package: \n\n- <https://usethis.r-lib.org>\n\nFWIW, this is how I create R packages.\n\n:::\n\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n- <https://rdpeng.github.io/Biostat776/lecture-building-r-packages>\n- <https://r-pkgs.org>\n- <https://stat545.com/package-overview>\n- <https://usethis.r-lib.org>\n\n:::\n",
