# Introduction

We we use interact with computers, we often do so with a keyboard and mouse, touch screen interfaces, or using speech recognition systems.

The most widely used way to interact with personal computers is called a **graphical user interface** (GUI). With a GUI, we give instructions by **clicking a mouse** and using menu-driven interactions.

The **problem with only working with GUIs** is that while the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn, this way of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly.

::: callout-note
### Example

Imagine the following task: for a literature search, you have to

1.  Copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories
2.  Paste the lines into a separate single file.

Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours, but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task.
:::

This is where we take advantage of the **Unix shell**.

The Unix shell is both

1.  A **command-line interface** (CLI)
2.  A **scripting language**

This allows such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast. Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.

## The Shell

The **shell is a program** (or environment) where users can **type commands** and the commands can be executed. 

Another way of thinking about it is, a shell provides an **interface between the user and the UNIX system**.

::: callout-note
### Example types of shells

-   **Bash** (Bourne Again SHell). The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell --- so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.
-   **Zsh** (Z SHell). Zsh is built on top of bash with some additional features including providing the user with more flexibility by providing various features such as plug-in support, better customization, theme support, spelling correction, etc. Zsh is the default shell for macOS and Kali Linux.
:::

The **grammar of a shell** allows you to combine existing tools into powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically. 

Benefits: 

- **Sequences of commands** can be written into a script, improving the reproducibility of workflows.
- The command line is **often the easiest way to interact with remote machines** and supercomputers.
- Familiarity with the shell is near essential to **run a variety of specialized tools** and resources including **high-performance computing systems**.

Let's get started.

## Where to find the shell

- If you are **using Windows**, by default, Windows does not use bash, but instead [you will need to install one of several Windows-specific tools](https://happygitwithr.com/shell.html#shell) (like Git for Windows or PowerShell) to allow this kind of text-based interaction with your operating system. 
- If you are **using macOS**, Apple calls the shell 'Terminal'. There is an application you can open called 'Terminal' and it also appears in a tab next to the R console in the RStudio IDE. 

![](../../images/terminal.png)

[[Source](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal-in-the-RStudio-IDE)]

:::{.callout-tip}

### Demo

- Let's open up the `Terminal` application and also show you where the Terminal is within RStudio. 
- Next, let's show how to open up multiple terminals and close all terminals.

:::

:::{.callout-tip}

### The Unix shell setup

You can follow these directions for setting up your shell for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems: 

- <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup>

:::

## Opening the shell

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a prompt, indicating that the **shell is waiting for input**.

``` {.bash filename="Bash"}
$
```

The **shell typically uses `$` as the prompt**, but may use a different symbol (for the purposes of the rest of the lecture, I will omit the `$`).

::: callout-important
1.  When typing commands in the shell, **do not type the `$`**, only the commands that follow it.
2.  After you type a command, you have to **press the Enter key** to execute it.
:::

The prompt is followed by a **text cursor**, a character that indicates the position where your typing will appear.

## Shell basics 

So let's try our first command, `ls` which is short for **listing files**. With R, we know how to do this with `list.files()` function in base R: 

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
list.files()
```

This command will list the contents of the current directory where the lecture is located. In RStudio, we can write a bash code block like this: 

```{{bash}}
ls
```

and the executed code block is this: 

```{bash}
ls
```

:::{.callout-note}

If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it will print an error message such as:

```{bash, error=TRUE}
ks
```

This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command is not installed.
:::


Next, lets learn to display

- basic information about the user
- the current date & time
- the calendar
- and clear the screen

| Command	| Description | R command | 
| ------- | ------------| --------- |   
| `whoami`        |     Who is the user? | `Sys.info()` / `whoami::whoami()` | 
| `date`	        |     Get date, time and timezone | `Sys.time()` |
| `cal`           |     Display calendar | 
| `clear`         |     Clear the screen | Ctrl + L

`whoami` **prints the user id** (i.e. the name of the user who runs the command). Use it to verify the user as which you are logged into the system.

```{bash}
whoami
```

`date` will **display** or change the value of the **system’s time and date** information.

```{bash}
date
```

`cal` will display a formatted calendar and clear will clear all text on the screen and display a new prompt.

```{bash}
cal
```

:::{.callout-tip}

### Pro-tip

To **clear** the R console and the shell, we use Ctrl + L.

:::

## Getting help

Before we proceed further, let us learn to view the documentation/manual pages of the commands.

| Command	| Description |  
| ------- | ------------| 
| `nameofcommand -h` | For some `nameofcommand` command (only for some commands)
| `man nameofcommand`   | Display manual pages (i.e. `man`) for the `nameofcommand` command | 
| `whatis` | Single line description of a command | 

`man` is used to view the system’s reference manual.

``` {.bash}
man date 
```

``` {.md} 
DATE(1)                          General Commands Manual                          DATE(1)

NAME
     date – display or set date and time

SYNOPSIS
     date [-jnRu] [-r seconds | filename] [-v [+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ... [+output_fmt]
     date [-ju] [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]
     date [-jRu] -f input_fmt new_date [+output_fmt]
     date [-jnu] [-I[FMT]] [-f input_fmt] [-r ...] [-v ...] [new_date]

DESCRIPTION
     When invoked without arguments, the date utility displays the current date and time.
```

:::{.callout-note}

### Try it out

Let's explore the manual pages of `date` in the command line to show you what that looks like. 

- We will figure out what is the argument to print out the number of seconds since the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) or 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.
- We will figure out what is the argument to display the date in UTC.


```{bash}
## try it out 

```


:::


:::{.callout-tip}

### Pro-tip

For **most commands** (but not all!), `NAMEOFCOMMAND -h` or `NAMEOFCOMMAND --help` will bring up a small guide to command options.

For example, `python -h` or `python --help` bring up:

``` md
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-b     : issue warnings about str(bytes_instance), str(bytearray_instance)
         and comparing bytes/bytearray with str. (-bb: issue errors)
-B     : don't write .pyc files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : turn on parser debugging output (for experts only, only works on
         debug builds); also PYTHONDEBUG=x
-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit (also --help)
-i     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
         if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
```

:::



# Move around files

## Navigate the file system

Next, we will introduce commands that help us:

- navigate between different folders/directories
- return current working directory
- list all the files & folders in a directory
- create and delete directories

| Command	| Description | R commands | 
| ------- | ------------| --------- |   
| `pwd`   | Print working directory | `here::here()` | 
| `ls`    | List directory contents | `dir()` / `list.files()` / `list.dirs()` |
| `cd`    |	Change current working directory | `setwd()` | 
| `mkdir`	| Create directory | `dir.create()` | 
| `rmdir`	| Remove/delete directory | 

`pwd` **displays the name and path** of the present (or current) working directory (`pwd`).

```{bash}
pwd
```

`ls` **displays information about files** and directories in the current directory along with their associated metadata such as

- size
- ownership
- modification date


With no options, it will list the files and directories in the current directory, **sorted alphabetically**.

```{bash}
ls
```

`cd` (change directory) changes the current working directory. It is among the most used commands as it allows the user **to move around the file system**.

```{bash}
cd .. 
ls
```

:::{.callout-note}

The `cd ..`	means to change to the directory that is one level up. 

:::

`mkdir` will **create new directory**. 

It will allow you to set file mode (permissions associated with the directory) i.e. who can open/modify/delete the directory.

It will give you a warning **if a folder already exists**.

```{bash}
mkdir secret_directory
ls
```


:::{.callout-note}

### Pro-tip

**Pressing tab** at any time within the shell will prompt it to attempt to either

- auto-complete the name of the command you are searching for
- auto-complete the line based on the files or sub-directories in the current directory. 

Where **two or more files have the same characters**, the auto-complete will only fill up to the first point of difference, after which we can add more characters, and try using tab again. 

:::

`rmdir` will **remove empty directories** from the file system. It can be used to remove multiple empty directories as well. 

If the **directory is not empty**, `rmdir` will not remove it and instead display a warning that the directory is not empty.

```{bash}
rmdir secret_directory
ls
```

## Change working directory

Let us focus a bit more on changing working directory. The below table shows commands for changing working directory to

- up one level
- previous working directory
- home directory
- and root directory

| Command	| Description |  
| ------- | ------------| 
| `cd .`    |	Navigate into directory |
| `cd ..`    |	Go up one level | 
| `cd -`    |	Go to previous working directory | 
| `cd ~`    |	Change directory to home directory | 
| `cd /`    |	Change directory to root directory | 

```{bash}
cd ..
ls 
```


This is a list of top-level files in my folder containing all the files for this website.

```{bash}
cd ../..
ls
```

These are all the files in my home directory on my computer.

```{bash}
cd ~ 
ls 
```



## List directory contents

`ls` will list the contents of a directory. Using different arguments, we can

- list hidden files
- view file permissions, ownership, size & modification date
- sort by size & modification date

| Command	| Description |  
| ------- | ------------| 
| `ls` | List directory contents | 
| `ls -l` | List files one per line | 
| `ls -a` | List all files including hidden files | 
| `ls -la` | Display file permissions, ownership, size & modification date | 
| `ls -lh` | Long format list with size displayed in human readable format | 
| `ls -lS` | Long format list sorted by size | 
| `ls -ltr` | Long format list sorted by modification date | 

List files one per line
```{bash}
cd ../..
ls -l
```

### Hidden files

Next, let's talk about **hidden (or invisible) files**. These are everywhere on modern operating systems. 

When a programmer needs to have a file or folder, but does not want to show it to the user, they prefixes the file name with a single period (.). The operating system then hides this files from the user.

But now you can **see these invisible files** using the command line. Just use the `-a` flag (short for "all") for the `ls` command to have it show you all the files that are there:

```{bash}
cd ../..
ls -a
```

Yes, we have lots of hidden files and folders in our course repository: `.git`, `.github`, `.gitignore`, `.quarto`, etc. 

These are normal files — you can move them, rename them, or open them like any other — they are just hidden by default. 


Next, we can display file permissions, ownership, size & modification date
```{bash}
cd ../..
ls -la
```

Display size in human readable format
```{bash}
cd ../..
ls -lh
```


### Wildcards

**Wildcards** are the use of asterisk (`*`) to **allow any pattern to appear** in part of a filename. 

For example, to list all the `.txt` files in a folder (but only the `.txt` files), you can type:

```{bash}
ls *.txt
```

Or if you wanted to see any file in the directory that has a "r" in it

```{bash}
ls *r*
```

This is an extremely powerful tool, and one you will likely use a lot. 


:::{.callout-note}

### Question

Let's try to write the command to pattern match all files that start with the pattern "team"

```{bash}
### try it out

```


:::

# Create, copy, rename, delete files

In this section, we will explore commands for file management including:

- create new file/change timestamps
- copying files
- renaming/moving files
- deleting files
- comparing files

| Command	| Description |  R commands |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | 
| `touch` | Create empty file(s)/change timestamp | `file.create()` | 
| `cp`    |	Copy files and folders | `file.copy()` |
| `mv`    |	Rename/move file | `file.rename()` | 
| `rm`    |	Remove/delete file | `file.remove()` | 
| `diff`  |	Compare files | | 

## Create new file

`touch` modifies file timestamps which is information associated with file modification. It can be any of the following:

- access time (the last time the file was read)
- modification time (the last time the contents of the file was changed)
- change time (the last time the file’s metadata was changed)

If the **file does not exist**, it will create an empty file of the same name.

:::{.callout-tip}

### Example

Let us use touch to create a new file `secret_analysis.R`.

```{bash}
touch secret_analysis.R
ls
```

:::


## Copy files and folders

`cp` makes copies of files and directories. 

:::{.callout-note}

By default, it will overwrite files without prompting for confirmation so be cautious while copying files or folders.

:::


:::{.callout-tip}

### Example

Let us create a copy of `team_standings.csv` file and name it as `team_standings_2.csv` in the same folder.

```{bash}
cp team_standings.csv team_standings_2.csv
ls
```

:::

To **copy folders**, you use the `-r` option which refers to `--recursive` i.e. copy directories recursively.

```{bash}
cp -r secret_directory secret_directory_2
ls secret*
```

## Move and rename files

`mv` moves and renames files and directories. Using different options, we can ensure

- files are not overwritten
- user is prompted for confirmation before overwriting files
- details of files being moved is displayed


| Command	| Description | 
| ------- | ------------ | 
| `mv`    | Move or rename files/directories
| `mv -f` | Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting files
| `mv -i` | Prompt for confirmation before overwriting files
| `mv -n` | Do not overwrite existing files
| `mv -v` | Move files in verbose mode

Let us move/rename the `team_standings_2.csv` file to `team_standings_3.csv` in verbose mode. 

```{bash}
mv -v team_standings_2.csv team_standings_3.csv
ls team*
```

We see that there is no more file called `team_standings_2.csv` as it's now been renamed! 


## remove/delete files

The `rm` command is used to delete/remove files & folders. Using additional options, we can

- remove directories & sub-directories
- forcibly remove directories
- interactively remove multiple files
- display information about files removed/deleted

| Command	| Description | 
| ------- | ------------ | 
| `rm`    | Remove files/directories | 
| `rm -r`  | Recursively remove a directory & all its subdirectories | 
| `rm -rf`  | 	Forcibly remove directory without prompting for confirmation or showing error messages | 
| `rm -i`  | Interactively remove multiple files, with a prompt before every removal | 
| `rm -v`  | Remove files in verbose mode, printing a message for each removed file | 

Let's remove the `secret_analysis.R` file that we created earlier with the `touch` command. 

```{bash}
rm secret_analysis.R
ls
```

To remove a folder (and all of it's contents), we need to use recursive deletion with `-r`

```{bash}
rm -r secret_directory_2
ls
```




# Input and output

In this section, we will explore commands that will

- display messages
- print file contents
- sort file contents
- count length of file

| Command	| Description | 
| ------- | ------------ |
| `echo`    | Display messages |
| `cat`     | Print contents of a file |
| `head`    | Prints first ten lines of a file by default |
| `tail`    | Prints last ten lines of a file by default |
| `more`    | Open a file for interactive reading, scrolling and searching |
| `less`    | Open a file for interactive reading, scrolling and searching |
| `sort`    | Sort a file in ascending order |
| `wc`      | Count length (words or lines) in a file | 

## Display messages

The `echo` command **prints text** to the terminal. 

It can be used for writing or appending messages to a file as well.

| Command	| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `echo`        | Display messages | 
| `echo -n`     | Print message without trailing new line | 
| `echo > file` | Write message to a file | 
| `echo -e`     | Enable interpretation of special characters | 

Let us start with a simple example. We will print the text "Funny-Looking Kid" to the terminal. It is the release name for R version 4.2.1.

```{bash}
echo Funny-looking Kid
```

If we wanted to redirect that output from printing to the terminal and write to a file, we use the redirection (`>`) operator.

```{bash}
echo Funny-looking Kid > r_release.txt
cat r_release.txt
```

:::{.callout-tip}

### Redirection operator

If we want to redirect that output from printing to the terminal and write to a file, we use the `>` operator like so (`command > [file] `) where on the left side is output gets piped into a file on the right side. 

:::


## The PATH variable

An important feature of the command line is the PATH variable. 

I won't get into all the details about the PATH variable, but having a basic understanding will likely prove useful if you ever have to troubleshoot problems in the future.

- Have you ever wondered how the command-line knows what to do when you type a command like `python` or `ls`? 
- How does it know what program to run, especially on a computer that might have multiple installations of a program like Python?

The answer is that **your system has a list of folders stored in an “environment variable” called PATH**. 

When you run a command (like `python` or `ls`), it goes through those folders in order until it **finds an executable file with the name of the command you typed**. 

Then, when it finds that file, it executes that program and stops looking.

You can see the value of the PATH variable on your computer by typing 

```{bash}
echo $PATH
```

That means that when I type `python`, my computer will first look in the folder `/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniforge/base/bin` to see if there is a file named `python` it can run. If it can’t find one there, it moves on to to the next one. 

### Why is this useful

In a perfect world, you will never have to worry about your PATH variable, but there are a couple situations where **knowing about your PATH variable can be helpful**. In particular:

1. If you **downloaded a program**, but you cannot run it from the command line, that probably means that its location is not in the PATH variable.
2. If you find that when you type a command like `python`, the command line is not running the version of python you want it to run, that’s probably because a different version of python appears earlier in the PATH variable (since the command line will stop looking through these folders as soon as it finds a match). 

:::{.callout-note}

You can diagnose this problem by typing `which COMMANDNAME`, which will tell you the folder from which `COMMANDNAME` is being run.

```{bash}
which python
```

```{bash}
which ls
```

:::

## Print file contents

The `cat` (stands for **cat**enate) command reads data from files, and outputs (or prints) their contents to the screen. 

:::{.callout-tip}

### Example

Let's consider the `release_names.txt` file, which contains release names of different R versions.

If we wanted to print the file contents to the screen: 

```{bash}
cat release_names.txt
```

:::


If we wanted to **number all the output**, use the `-n` option: 

```{bash}
cat -n release_names.txt 
```

To concatenate several source (or input) files into one final target (or output) file, we can also use the redirect operator (`>`): 

```{bash}
cat r_release.txt release_names.txt > combined_names.txt
cat combined_names.txt
```

- The `head` command will **display the first 10 lines** of a file(s) by default.
- The `tail` command **displays the last 10 lines** of a file(s) by default.

It can be used to display the first (or last) few lines or bytes of a file as well.

| Command	| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `head` | Output the first parts of a file | 
| `head -n num` | Output the first `num` lines of a file | 
| `head -c num` | Output the first `num` bytes of a file | 
| `tail` | Display the last part of a file | 
| `tail -n num` | Show the last `num` lines of a file | 
| `tail -n +num` | Show all contents of the file starting from `num` line | 
| `tail -c num` | Show last `num` bytes of a file | 

To show the head of the first 8 lines of the `combined_names.txt` file: 

```{bash}
head -c 8 combined_names.txt 
```

To show all the lines starting from line 8 and beyond: 

```{bash}
tail -n +8 combined_names.txt 
```

The `more` command displays text, one screen at a time. It opens a file for

- interactive reading
- scrolling
- searching

:::{.callout-tip}

Press space to scroll down the page, the forward slash (`/`) for searching strings, `n` to go to the next match, and `q` to quit.

:::

| Command	| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `more`    | Open a file for interactive reading, scrolling and searching |
| `space`   | Page down |
| `/`       | Search for a string; press n to go the next match |
| `q`       | Quit |

The `less` command is similar to more, but offers more features. 

It **allows the user to scroll up and down the file**, go to the beginning and end of the file, forward and backward search and the ability to go the next and previous match while searching the file.

| Command	| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `less	`   | Open a file for interactive reading, scrolling and searching | 
| `space`   | Page down | 
| `b`   | Page up | 
| `G`   | Go to the end of file | 
| `g`   | Go to the start of file | 
| `/`   | Forward search | 
| `?`   | Backward search | 
| `n`   | Go to next match | 
| `N`   | Go to previous match | 
| `q`   | Quit | 


## Sort files

The `sort` command will **sort the contents of text file**, line by line. Using additional options, we can

- sort a file in ascending/descending order
- ignore case while sorting
- use numeric order for sorting
- preserve only unique lines while sorting

:::{.callout-tip}

Using the `sort` command, the contents can be **sorted numerically and alphabetically**. By default, the rules for sorting are:

- lines starting with a number will appear before lines starting with a letter.
- lines starting with a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet will appear before lines starting with a letter that appears later in the alphabet.
- lines starting with a lowercase letter will appear before lines starting with the same letter in uppercase.

:::

Using additional options, the rules for sorting can be changed. We list the options in the below table.

| Command	| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `sort` | Sort lines of text files
| `sort -r` | Sort a file in descending order
| `sort --ignore-case` | Ignore case while sorting
| `sort -n` | Use numeric order for sorting
| `sort -u` | Preserve only unique lines while sorting

Here we are sorting in a descending alphabetical order of the `combined_names.txt`

```{bash}
sort -r combined_names.txt
```


## Count length of file

`wc` (word count) will **print newline, word, and byte counts** for file(s). 

```{bash}
wc combined_names.txt
```

```{bash}
wc -l combined_names.txt
```

```{bash}
wc -w combined_names.txt
```

```{bash}
wc -c combined_names.txt
```


If more than one file is specified, it will also print total line.

```{bash}

# Search and regular expression 

In this section, we will explore commands that will

- search for a given string in a file
- find files using names
- search for binary executable files


| Command	| Description | 
| ------- | ------------ |
| `grep` | Search for a given string in a file | 
| `find` | Find files using filenames | 
| `which` | Search for binary executable files | 


## Search for a string in a file

The `grep` command is used for **pattern matching**. Along with additional options, it can be used to

- match pattern in input text
- ignore case
- search recursively for an exact string
- print filename and line number for each match
- invert match for excluding specific strings

`grep` (stands for **g**lobal **r**egular **e**x**p**ression) **processes text line by line**, and prints any lines which match a specified pattern. 

It is a powerful tool for matching a regular expression against text in a file, multiple files, or a stream of input.

| Command	| Description | 
| ------- | ------------ |
| `grep` | Matches pattern in input text
| `grep -i` | Ignore case
| `grep -RI` | Search recursively for an exact string
| `grep -E` | Use extended regular expression
| `grep -Hn` | Print file name & corresponding line number for each match
| `grep -v` | Invert match for excluding specific strings

First, we will search for packages that include the letter "R" in a list of R package names (`package_names.txt`). 

```{bash}
grep R package_names.txt
```

If you are familiar with regular expressions, you can do cool things like search for a "r" followed by a white space with the `\s` character set for white spaces. 

```{bash}
grep -i 'r\s' release_names.txt
```

If there is more than one file to search, use the `-H` option to print the filename for each match.

```{bash}
grep -H F r_release.txt package_names.txt
```

And here is the file name and line number

```{bash}
grep -Hn F r_release.txt package_names.txt
```

And here we invert match for excluding the string "R"

```{bash}
grep -vi R r_release.txt package_names.txt
```

# System info 

In this section, we will explore commands that will allow us to

- display information about the system
- display file system disk space usage
- exit the terminal
- run commands a superuser
- shutdown the system

| Command	| Description | 
| ------- | ------------ |
| `uname` | Display important information about the system
| `df` | Display file system disk space usage |
| `exit` | Exit the terminal |
| `sudo` | Run command as super user |
| `shutdown` | Shutdown the system | 


For example, we can display the file system disk usage 

```{bash}
df
```
# R in the shell

In this section, we will learn to execute R commands and scripts in the command line using:

- `R -e`
- `Rscript -e`
- `R CMD BATCH`

The `-e` option allows us to specify R expression(s). 

`R -e` will launch R and then execute the code specified within quotes. 

- Use semi-colon to execute multiple expressions as shown below. 
- You will be able to run the below commands only if you are able to launch R from the command line. (**Demo this**).
- Windows users need to ensure that R is added to the path environment.

```{bash}
R -e "head(mtcars); tail(mtcars)"
```

`Rscript -e` will run code without launching R.

```{bash}
Rscript -e "head(mtcars); tail(mtcars)"
```

We can use `Rscript` to execute a R script as well. In the below example, we execute the code in `analysis.R` file (which just asks to print the head of `mtcars`).

```{bash}
cat analysis.R
```

```{bash}
Rscript analysis.R
```

    - CLI (Command Line Interface)
    - Terminal
    - Bash (Bourne Again Shell)
- Use `Rscript -e` or `R -e` to execute R scripts from the command line
- RStudio includes a Terminal (from version 1.1.383)
- Execute commands from shell script in RStudio using Ctrl + Enter
- RMarkdown and Quarto supports bash, sh and awk

### Final Questions

Here are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.

::: callout-note
### Questions

1. Explore the help files of `tar` and `gzip` commands for compressing files.
2. Move around the computer, get used to moving in and out of directories, see how different file types appear in the Unix shell. Be sure to use the `pwd` and `cd` commands, and the different flags for the `ls` commands. 
3. Practice using "Tab for Auto-complete" in the shell to autocomplete commands or file names.
4. Practice your command line knowledge with [Command Challenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/).
