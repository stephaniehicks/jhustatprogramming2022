# Introduction

### What is version control and why should I use it?

We'll start by exploring how version control can be used to keep track of what one person did and when.

For a nice illustration, we will refer to the [Software Carpentry: Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/01-basics/index.html) lesson materials.


### Overview

We've all been in this situation before: it seems unnecessary to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word's Track Changes or Google Docs' version history.

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then record changes you make each step of the way.

For example, two users can make independent sets of changes on the same document.

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files.

It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a commit), and keeps useful metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people.

### Terminology

1.  `commit`: a record of each set of changes in a document or file
2.  `repository`: the complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata

### Key Points

1.  Version control is like an unlimited 'undo'.
2.  Version control also allows many people to work in parallel.

# Setting Up Git

### How do I get set up to use Git?

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time, we need to configure a few things:

-   our name and email address
-   what our preferred text editor is
-   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`, where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information.

Here is how to set up Git on a new laptop:

```
$ git config --global user.name "My Name"
$ git config --global user.email "myemail@email.com"
```

This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity after this lesson.

For this lesson, we will be interacting with GitHub and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account.


### Check settings

You can check your settings at any time:

```
$ git config --list
```

### Git Help and Manual

If you forget the options of a `git` command, you can type `git <command> -h` or access the corresponding Git manual by typing `git <command> --help`, e.g.:

```
$ git config -h
$ git config --help
```

You can press Q to exit the manual.

You can also get the list of available git commands and further resources of the Git manual typing:

```
$ git help
```

# Creating a Repository

Once Git is configured, we can start using it.

First, let's create a new directory in the Desktop folder for our work and then change the current working directory to the newly created one:

```
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir planets
cd planets
pwd
```

Then we tell Git to make `planets` a repository â€“ a place where Git can store versions of our files:

```
git init
```

Note that the creation of the `planets` directory and its initialization as a repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents, it appears that nothing has changed:

```
ls
```

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything, we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within planets called `.git`:

```
ls -a
```

Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project, including the tracked files and sub-directories located within the project's directory.

If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory, we will lose the project's history.

Next, we will change the default branch to be called `main.` This might be the default branch depending on your settings and version of git.

```
git checkout -b main
```

We can check that everything is set up correctly by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```
git status
```

### Correcting git init Mistakes

Suppose you have created the Git repository in the wrong directory, or made some other mistake.

You can delete the git repository by simply deleting the `.git` directory, either in Finder / Windows Explorer or from the command line:

```
rm -rf .git
```

But be careful! Running this command in the wrong directory will remove the entire Git history of a project you might want to keep. Therefore, always check your current directory using the command `pwd`.

### Key Points

-   `git init` initializes a repository.
-   Git stores all of its repository data in the `.git` directory.
