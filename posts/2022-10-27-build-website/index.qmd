# Learning objectives

**At the end of this lesson you will:**

- Be able to describe reasons why having a personal website can be useful. 
- Recognize what is Quarto and how it's different from RMarkdown.
- Convert a RMarkdown file (`.Rmd`) to a Quarto file (`.qmd`).

# Introduction 

A professional web presence through a personal website can be powerful given the world we live in with much of our lives on the web (e.g. zoom meetings). 

There are many great tools to be able to help you get started on building a personal website.

:::{.callout-tip}

### Reasons why creating a personal website can be helpful

1. A website gives you a home to build a brand for yourself and summarize the work you do. 
2. You can connect with broader audiences.
3. A website can give you broader professional visibility. 
4. Creating a website demonstrates literacy with working with websites.
5. In addition to the scholarship you are creating, a website gives an opportunity for others to connect with you (rather than just learn about your scholarship).
6. It helps future employers learn about who you are.

# What is Quarto?


[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a publishing system built on Pandoc that allows users to create dynamic content using R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS (with plans to add more languages too!).

R users have long loved [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for combining prose, code, and outputs into single "knitted" documents. Quarto extends all of RMarkdown's best features (plus many more!) to additional languages.

:::

You can explore [Quarto's documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) to learn more about creating documents, websites, blogs, books, slides, etc.

You use one file format and one syntax to be able to create many different types of outputs:

  - Website
  - Publications
  - Books
  - Dashboards

:::{.callout-tip}

### Quarto highlights

- Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
- Author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.
- Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
- Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

:::


## .qmd files

Quarto files end in a `.qmd`. This is short for **q**uarto **m**ark**d**own. 

:::{.callout-note}

### Note

These files are decoupled from RStudio IDE and there are plugins to work with `.qmd` files for 

- VSCode
- JupyterLab
- RStudio

:::

You can render `.qmd` files within RStudio, just like a `.Rmd` file. 

Another useful thing quarto is that you can render `.qmd` files on the command line: 

```{.bash}
quarto render my_document.qmd
```

:::{.callout-tip}

### Quarto supports multiple languages

These languages include

  - R
  - Python
  - Julia
  - Observable
  
Quarto can also [interchange between languages using Apache Arrow](https://gist.github.com/hrbrmstr/23355194d1964688596553a0e6a0050a).

:::


### How does multi-language support work? 

The idea behind how quarto supports multi-language code is that the code output is "frozen" by default after it is rendered. 

In this way, code output is not recomputed, unless you want it to (`quarto render --execute`). 

There is a file called `_quarto.yml` and in the file, you can set a global argument in the following way: 

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```


## R Markdown vs Quarto

Some differences include

- Standardized YAML across formats
- Decoupled from RStudio
- More consistent presentation across formats
- Tab Panels 
- Code Highlighting

### code chunks

Another noticeable difference are arguments for code chunks. Rather than being in the header of the code chunk, arguments are **moved to within the code chunk** using the `#|` (hash-pipe) for each line. 

This is a code chunk for R Markdown: 

````{.markdown}
```{{r setup, include=FALSE}}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
```
````

This is a code chunk for Quarto: 

````{.markdown}
```{{r}}
#| label: "setup"
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
```
````

### Should you switch to quarto?

> Should you switch to Quarto? Not necessarily. 
> If you find R Markdown meet your need, you can definitely stay there. It is not imperative to switch. - Yihui Xie

## Freeze Results and avoid recomputing

Freezing code output is generally used when you have either 

- A large number of collaborators or 
- Many computational documents created over a longer period of time

In both cases it can be challenging to fully re-execute every document when you render the site. This could be because some documents have esoteric or environment-specific requirements (e.g. require access/authentication to a data source) or due to general fragility of dependencies over time. 

Using freeze ensures that you can always reproducibly render your site.

The computational results of documents executed with `freeze` are stored in the `_freeze/` directory, and re-used when needed to fulfill document renders.

You should check the contents of `_freeze/` into version control so that others rendering the project don't need to reproduce your computational environment to render it in their environment.

:::{.callout-note}

### Note

You will still want to take care to fully re-render your project when things outside of source code change (e.g. input data). 

You can remove previously frozen output by deleting the `_freeze` folder at the root of your project.

:::

For example, consider the `_quarto.yml` file. 

One argument in the file is the `freeze` option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during a global project render, or alternatively only be re-rendered when their source file changes:

``` yaml
project:
  title: "qmd_rmd"
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
  
execute:
  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render
```

``` yaml
project:
  title: "qmd_rmd"
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```

:::{.callout-note}

### Note

`freeze` controls whether **execution occurs** during global project renders. 

If you do an incremental render of either a single document or a project sub-directory then code is always executed. For example:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# render single document (always executes code)
quarto render document.qmd

# render project subdirectory (always executes code)
quarto render articles
```

:::

# Deploying a website 

`quarto publish` can push and update a number of different kinds of webhosts. 
You will need credentials to publish to each of these.

```{.bash}
quarto publish gh-pages    # GitHub Pages
quarto publish quarto-pub  # Quarto.pub 
quarto publish netlify     # Netlify
quarto publish connect     # RStudio Connect
```


# Quarto demo

Demo in class, but here are the general steps: 

1. Create a new Quarto project
2. Edit `_quarto.yml` file
3. Add / delete relevant content
4. Render the website
5. Deploy the website


## Next steps

Here are some tutorials I really like for getting started with Quarto generally and for getting started building and deploying websites with Quarto: 

- [Creating Quarto websites](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites)
- [Customize Quarto websites](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites)
