```

# Motivation

Today we are going to talk about getting data from APIs and
examples of common data formats. 

First let's have a bit of a philosophical 
discussion about data. 

## "Raw" vs "Clean" data

As data analysts, this is what we wished data 
looked like whenever we start a project

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/tidy-data-example.png")
```

However, the reality, is data is rarely in that 
form in comes in all types of _"raw"_ formats that 
need to be transformed into a _"clean"_ format. 

For example, in field of genomics, raw data 
looks like something like this: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/fastq.png")
```

Or if you are interested in analyzing data from 
Twitter: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/twitter-api.png")
```

Or data from Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs): 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/ehr.png")
```

We all have our scary spreadsheet tales. Here is 
Jenny Bryan from Posit and UBC actually asking 
for some of those spreadsheet tales on twitter. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/spreadsheet-tales.png")
```

For example, this is an actual 
[spreadsheet from Enron in 2001](https://github.com/jennybc/2016-06_spreadsheets/blob/master/2016-06_useR-stanford.pdf): 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/enron-spreadsheet.png")
```

## What do we mean by "raw" data? 

From [https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2016-07-20-relativity-raw-data/](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2016-07-20-relativity-raw-data/)
raw data is defined as data... 

> ...if you have done no processing, manipulation, coding, or analysis of the data. In other words, the file you received from the person before you is untouched. But it may not be the rawest version of the data. The person who gave you the raw data may have done some computations. They have a different "raw data set".

## Where do data live? 

Data lives anywhere and everywhere. Data 
might be stored simply in a `.csv` or `.txt`
file. Data might be stored in an Excel or 
Google Spreadsheet. Data might be stored in 
large databases that require users to write 
special functions to interact with to extract 
the data they are interested in. 

For example, you may have heard of the terms 
`mySQL` or `MongoDB`. 

From [Wikipedia, MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) 
is defined as _an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7] and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language_. 

From [Wikipeda, MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB)
is defined as _"a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemata."_

So after reading that, we get the sense that there
are multiple ways large databases can be structured, 
data can be formatted and interacted with. 
In addition, we see that database programs 
(e.g. MySQL and MongoDB) can also interact 
with each other.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/databases.png")
```

We will learn more about `JSON` today and learn about `SQL` in a later lecture more formally. 

# Best practices on sharing data

A great article in PeerJ was written 
titled [_How to share data for collaboration_](https://peerj.com/preprints/3139v5.pdf), 
in which the authors describe a set of guidelines
for sharing data:

> We highlight the need to provide raw data to the statistician, the importance of consistent formatting, and the necessity of including all essential experimental information and pre-processing steps carried out to the statistician. With these guidelines we hope to avoid errors and delays in data analysis. the importance of consistent formatting, and the necessity of including all essential experimental information and pre-processing steps carried out to the statistician.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/ellis-datashare.png")
```

It's a great paper that describes the information 
you should pass to a statistician to facilitate 
the most efficient and timely analysis. Specifically:

1. The raw data (or the rawest form of the data to which you have access)
    * Should not have modified, removed or summarized any data; Ran no software on data
    * e.g. strange binary file your measurement machine spits out
    * e.g. complicated JSON file you scrapped from Twitter Application Programming Interfaces (API)
    * e.g. hand-entered numbers you collected looking through a microscope

2. A clean data set
    * This may or may not be transforming data into a `tidy` dataset, but possibly yes

3. A code book describing each variable and its values in the clean or tidy data set.
    * More detailed information about the measurements in the data set (e.g. units, experimental design, summary choices made)
    * Doesn't quite fit into the column names in the spreadsheet
    * Often reported in a `.md`, `.txt` or Word file. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/code-book.png")
```

4. An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 -> 2,3

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/raw/master/imgs/recipe-best.png")
```

# Getting data

## JSON files 

JSON (or JavaScript Object Notation) is a file
format that stores information in human-readable, 
organized, logical, easy-to-access manner.

For example, here is what a JSON file looks 
like: 

``` md
var stephanie = {
	"age" : "33",
	"hometown" : "Baltimore, MD",
	"gender" : "female", 
  "cars" : {
    "car1" : "Hyundai Elantra",
    "car2" : "Toyota Rav4",
    "car3" : "Honda CR-V"
  }
}
```

Some features about `JSON` object: 

* JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces `{}`
* JSON objects are written in key/value pairs
* Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean)
* Keys and values are separated by a colon
* Each key/value pair is separated by a comma



## Gettting data from an API

[From AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/), API stands for **Application Programming Interface**. 

- "Application" = any software with a distinct function
- "Interface" = a **contract of service** between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. 

The **API documentation** contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.

:::{.callout-tip}

### Purpose of APIs

The purpose of APIs is enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. 

For example, the weather bureauâ€™s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone "talks" to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.

:::


### How do APIs work?

To understand how APIs work, two terms that are important are 

1. **client**. This is the application sending the request.
2. **server**. This is the application sending the response.

So in the weather example, the bureau's weather database is the server, and the mobile app is the client. 

### Four types of API architectures

There are four different ways that APIs can work depending on when and why they were created.

1. **SOAP APIs**. These APIs use **Simple Object Access Protocol**. Client and server exchange messages using XML. This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.

2. **RPC APIs**. These APIs are called **Remote Procedure Calls**. The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the output back to the client.

3. **Websocket APIs**. Websocket API is another modern web API development that uses JSON objects to pass data. A WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client apps and the server. The server can send callback messages to connected clients, making it more efficient than REST API.

4. **REST APIs**. REST stands for **Representational State Transfer** (and are the most popular and flexible APIs). The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client. REST defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients can use to access server data. Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP.

- The main feature of REST API is **statelessness** (i.e. servers do not save client data between requests). Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain data, without the typical graphical rendering of a web page.


### How to use an API?

The basic steps to using an API are:

1. **Obtaining an API key**. This is done by creating a verified account with the API provider.
2. **Set up an HTTP API client**. This tool allows you to structure API requests easily using the API keys received. 
3. If you donâ€™t have an API client, you can try to structure the request yourself in your browser by referring to the API documentation.
4. Once you are comfortable with the new API syntax, you can start using it in your code.


### Where can I find new APIs?

New web APIs can be found on API marketplaces and API directories, such as:

- [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/) â€“ One of the largest global API markets (10k+ public APIs). Users to test APIs directly on the platform before committing to purchase.
- [Public REST APIs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/Szf7znEe) â€“ Groups REST APIs into categories, making it easier to browse and find the right one to meet your needs.
- [APIForThat](https://apiforthat.posthaven.com/) and [APIList](https://apilist.fun) â€“ Both these websites have lists of 500+ web APIs, along with in-depth information on how to use them.    



# Getting data from APIs

## GitHub API

The [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) may be of interest when studying online communities, working methods, organizational structures, communication and discussions, etc. with a focus on (open-source) software development. 

Many projects that are hosted on GitHub are open-source projects with a transparent development process and communications. For private projects, which can also be hosted on GitHub, thereâ€™s understandably only a few aggregate data available.

Let's say we want to use the 
[GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
to find out how many of my GitHub repositories
have open issues? 

:::{.callout-tip}

### Pro-tip

The API can be used for free and you can send up to 60 requests per hour if you are not authenticated (i.e. if you donâ€™t provide an API key). 

For serious data collection, this is not much, so it is recommended to sign up on GitHub and generate a personal access token that acts as API key. 

This token can then be used to authenticate your API requests. Your quota is then 5000 requests per hour.

:::

### Access the API from R

There are packages for many programming languages that provide convenient access for communicating with the GitHub API, but there are no such packages (that I'm aware of) for accessing the API from R.  

This means we can only access the API directly, e.g. by using the [`jsonlite`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) package to fetch the data and convert it to an R `list` or `data.frame`.

Specifically, we will use the `jsonlite::fromJSON()` function
to convert from a JSON object to a data frame. 

The JSON file is located at 
[https://api.github.com/users/stephaniehicks/repos](https://api.github.com/users/stephaniehicks/repos)

```{r}
github_url = "https://api.github.com/users/stephaniehicks/repos"

library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
jsonData <- as_tibble(fromJSON(github_url))
glimpse(jsonData)
```

The function `fromJSON()` has now converted 
the JSON file into a data frame with the names: 

```{r}
names(jsonData)
```

However, from here, we see that there are only 30 rows (or 30 repositories). 
If you look on my github page, you can see there are more than 30 repositories. 

- <https://github.com/stephaniehicks?tab=repositories> 

I have 85 public repositories as of today! 


:::{.callout-tip}

### APIs limit info from users

What's happening is called **pagination**. 

At a high-level, the API is limiting the amount of items a user gets and **splitting it into pages**.

Formally, pagination is the process of splitting the contents or a section of a website into discrete pages. Users tend to get lost when there's bunch of data and with pagination splitting they can concentrate on a particular amount of content. Hierarchy and paginated structure improve the readability score of the content.

In this use case Github api splits the result into 30 items per resonse, depends on the request

:::



**Solution**: You should explicitly specify in your request how many items you would like to receive from server pagination engine, using formula for Github pagination api: 

`?page=1&per_page=<numberOfItemsYouSpecify>"`

You can read more about pagination here: 

- <https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.6/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination>



:::{.callout-tip}

### Example

Here we can visit this website: 

- <https://api.github.com/users/stephaniehicks/repos?page=1&per_page=1000> 

And see there are more than 30 repos. Let's read it into R. 

```{r}
github_url = "https://api.github.com/users/stephaniehicks/repos?page=1&per_page=1000"

jsonDataAll <- as_tibble(fromJSON(github_url))
dim(jsonDataAll)
```

We now get all 85 repositories! yay! 

:::


### Using API keys

Authenticating with the GitHub API via an API key allows you to send much more requests to the API. 

API access keys for the GitHub API are called **personal access tokens** (PAT) and the [documentation explains how to generate a PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) once you have logged into your GitHub account. 

:::{.callout-tip}

### Where to store API keys

First, **please be careful with your PATs and never publish them.**

If you want guidance on where you should store them, I like this post: 

- <https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/11/how-to-store-and-use-webservice-keys-and-authentication-details-with-r/> 

Personally, I keep mine in my `.Renviron` file which looks something like this on the inside: 
```

GITHUB_API_KEY = <add my GitHub API key here> 
COVID_ACT_NOW_API_KEY = <add my COVID Act Now API key here> 
CENSUS_API_KEY = <add my tidycensus API key here> 

```

If you don't have an `.Renviron` file in your home directory, you can make one: 

``` bash
cd 
touch .Renviron
```

:::


Assuming you have created and stored an API key in the `.Renviron` file in your home directory, you can fetch it with the `Sys.getenv()` function. 

```{r}
github_key <- Sys.getenv("GITHUB_API_KEY")
```

We will use this in a little bit. 



### Using the HTTP verb `GET`

There are a set of [basic HTTP verbs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/eloqua-develop/Developers/GettingStarted/APIRequests/HTTP-verbs.htm) that allow you access a set of **endpoints**. 

The basic request patterns are:

- Retrieve a single item (GET)
- Retrieve a list of items (GET)
- Create an item (POST)
- Update an item (PUT)
- Delete an item (DELETE)

Here, we will use the `GET()` function from [`httr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) package (i.e. tools to work with URLs and HTTP) to retrieve a single JSON file. 

We will also make this an **authenticated HTTP response** to the GitHub API using `authenticate()` from the `httr` package. 


:::{.callout-tip}

### Example 

Let's start by using the GitHub API to learn information about myself (Stephanie Hicks)

```{r}
library(httr)
github_key <- Sys.getenv("GITHUB_API_KEY")
response <- GET('https://api.github.com/user', 
                authenticate(user = 'stephaniehicks', 
                             password = github_key))
response
```

We see the response we got is a JSON file. 

:::

Next we extract / retrieve the contents from the raw JSON output using the `content()` function from the `httr` package. If you use the argument `as = 'text'`, it extracts the contents as a character vector. 

```{r}
account_details <- fromJSON(httr::content(response, as = 'text'))
account_details
```

Next, let's perform the same request we did above about my 85 repositories, but instead of reading in the JSON file from the web, we use an authenticated `GET()` response: 

```{r}
response <- GET('https://api.github.com/users/stephaniehicks/repos?page=1&per_page=1000',
                authenticate('stephaniehicks', github_key))
repo_details <- as_tibble(fromJSON(httr::content(response, as = 'text')))
repo_details
```

### EDA with data 

Let's have a bit of fun and explore some questions:  

- How many are private repos? 
- How many have forks? How many forks? 

```{r}
table(repo_details$private)
table(repo_details$forks)
```

What's the most popular language? 

```{r}
table(repo_details$language)
```

To find out how many repos that I have
with open issues, we can just create 
a table: 

```{r}
# how many repos have open issues? 
table(repo_details$open_issues_count)
```

Whew! Not as many as I thought.

:::{.callout}


### More about `GET`

You can use the `query` argument to specify details about the response. 

```{r}
library(httr)
req <- GET("https://api.github.com/repos/tidyverse/dplyr/issues", 
           query = list(state = "open", per_page = 100, page = 1))
dplyr_details <- as_tibble(fromJSON(httr::content(req, as = 'text')))
dplyr_details
```
